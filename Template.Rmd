# Top level title/section Title

## Sub-section title 

### Sub-sub-section

#### Really not important

Paragraph of something **text.** Highlight the word and press shift 8.
_italics_
**bold**
Make a list with an * or a dash - to create a bullted list of points. Stay consistent with one sign.

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

To write a code think of slack
use backticks ` code`and it gets marked-up

For numbered lists, start with numbers

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

if u use random numbers

5. Step 1
4. Step 2
7. Step 3

it still gives the right number order bc R recognises the number as such

## How to add images

### Of funny cats for examples

![Funny cat](http://images1.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/Funny-Cat-Pictures-animal-humor-935491_500_375.jpg)

**cats** are nice funny _animals_. Everyone should have

* 1 cat
* yummy food
* a fireplace

F^2^
good to do some exercise [^1]. You can write the food note here next to the text. But it will appear at the end!

[^1]: remember that speace and lines are quite important in RMarkdown
 
# Getting files from your computer

it depends on how the file path is written in windows. Use these forward slashes / not these \ for the file path. And add .png

No spaces after r

```{r global_options}
#to apply the same rules to all the chunks, to set default values
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2)

```


```{r load_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
gapminder <- read_csv("C:/Users/Valentina/Documents/GITHUB/EXCERCISES/gapminder_data.csv")
gapminder <- read_csv("C:/Users/Valentina/Documents/Gapminder_2/data/gapminder_data.csv")


```


echo= FALSE controls whether or not the code will be hown in the document
eval=FALSE doesn't run the code e.g. if the code takes a long time to run 
to show it just set echo=TRUE
results= how the results of the code are shown, at all or hidden, in disperse or hold i.e. wait until the very end of the block and print eveerything
message = true will show also the packages; so in the final version the packages are gone to get rid of the warning write "warning=FALSE"
R chunks allow us to customise ho the code etc are displayed in the final document
 
```{r filter, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE}
Australia <- filter(gapminder, country == params$country)
#aust_data
#results=FALSE won't show the results i.e. the tibble
```


```{r plots, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
p1 <- ggplot(Australia, aes(x=year, y=pop))+
  geom_point(colour="red", size=2)

p1

p1+labs(title= params$country)

```

to update a text.
E.g. we are working with Australia data only because 142 is too many.
What if the number gets updated?
```{r}
#you can write this in the console.
#use the `r length(unique(gapminder$country))and the line of your R code
length <- length(unique(gapminder$country))
```
so it becomes
we are working with `r  params$country` data only because `r length` is too many

the code needs to be small.
if not possible then use a code chunk on its own

```{r, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE}
n_countries <- length(unique(gapminder$country))
```

code won't be shown but run

we are working with `r params$country` data only because `r n_countries` is too many. 
 
```{r}
Rstudio <-  getRversion()
tidyverse <-  packageVersion("tidyverse")
```
 This document was created with R Studio `r Rstudio` version and the package tidyverse `r tidyverse` 
 
 NOPE!
 
 The right way is
 
 This document was created with R Studio `r getRversion()` version and the package tidyverse `r packageVersion("tidyverse")`
